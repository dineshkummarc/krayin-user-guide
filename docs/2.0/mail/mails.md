**"Mail"** typically refers to electronic mail, commonly known as email. It's a method of exchanging digital messages between people using electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets. Email is widely used for communication in both personal and professional settings. It allows users to send text-based messages, attachments (such as documents, images, or videos), and other digital content to one or more recipients over the internet. Email can be used for various purposes, including sending messages, sharing information, collaborating on projects, and conducting business communications.

## Compose

To compose an email is another term for writing an email. For many email providers, you see a button that says “compose email” which, when clicked on, will let you start writing an email to be sent to a recipient.

## Inbox

An inbox is a primary location where all incoming emails are stored in an email account. The first screen appears when you log in to your email account. The inbox displays the list of emails you have received, along with their subject lines, senders, and the date and time they were received.

## Draft

A "draft" in email refers to an unsent email message that is saved as a work-in-progress. Drafts are a useful feature in email because they allow users to start composing an email message, but then save it to be finished or edited at a later time.

## Outbox

An outbox is a folder in your email client that stores messages that have been composed but have not yet been sent. The messages remain in the outbox until they are successfully sent, at which point they are moved to the sent items folder.

## Sent 

With e-mail, Sent or Sent items is a folder or area that stores any e-mails that were successfully delivered. The sent items are different than the outbox, it's where e-mail stays until it's delivered.
