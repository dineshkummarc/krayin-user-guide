# Quotes

**Quotes** in the context of Customer Relationship Management (CRM), typically refer to formal proposals or estimates provided to potential customers outlining the products or services offered, along with their associated prices. These quotes serve as documented offers, detailing the terms and conditions of a potential sale. They often include itemized lists of products or services, quantities, pricing information, payment terms, and any applicable discounts or taxes.

CRM software often includes features for creating, managing, and tracking quotes as part of the sales process. This allows sales teams to efficiently generate and send quotes to leads or prospects, track their status, and follow up accordingly. Quotes play a crucial role in the sales cycle by providing transparency and clarity to both the seller and the buyer regarding the terms of a potential transaction.
